I was working as a Aerospace Engineer in Singapore. I used to live with Bending Moment, Structural Stress and FEM (Finite Element Modelling) everyday from 9-to-5. Now I am working as a Research Staff in NTU, DSAIR center. My main focus will be developing <a href="https://intellik.dsair.ntu.edu.sg/#/">Intellik</a>

> IntelliK is a game authoring platform which enables creative people to develop artificial intelligence (AI) powered digital games without requiring any programming skills.

and implementing various exciting AI features into the platform.

## ** You might think: How do I plan my journey to becoming a Deep Learning expert? **

I have given myself a very tight schedule to learn anything from basic machine learning techniques to advanced reinforcement learning. I have taken the entire specialization in deep learning which was taught by Dr Andrew Ng.

In case you are interested to see my courses that I have taken. Here is the list:
