I was working as a Aerospace Engineer in Singapore. I used to live with Bending Moment, Structural Stress and FEM (Finite Element Modelling) everyday from 9-to-5. Now I am working as a Research Staff in NTU, DSAIR center. My main focus will be developing <a href="https://intellik.dsair.ntu.edu.sg/#/">Intellik</a>

> IntelliK is a game authoring platform which enables creative people to develop artificial intelligence (AI) powered digital games without requiring any programming skills.

and implementing various exciting AI features into the platform.

## You might think: How do I plan my journey to becoming a Deep Learning expert?

I have given myself a very tight schedule to learn anything from basic machine learning techniques to advanced reinforcement learning. I have taken the entire specialization in deep learning which was taught by Dr Andrew Ng.

In case you are interested to see my courses that I have taken. Here is the list:

1. Deep Learning

## How to keep myself motivated throughout the journey?

<div class="message">
  Two items: Challenge and Reward
</div>

Human tends to work harder when we finish a particular task and get some rewards upon completion. I will be constantly posting what I have learned in the past and what I have observed from some of the great articles in personal blog. I will also be sharing the codes that I used to solve the challenges and document the analysis process. I hope these can keep me motivated enough to reach my desired goal. If you are a pass-by stranger who happen to read this blog, feel free to comment on my post and exchange some of the ideas that you have in mind. I consider myself as a global citizen and love to make friend with the world!

**See ya!**
